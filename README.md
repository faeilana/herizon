# Herizon — AI-Powered Women's Travel Simulator

**Herizon** is an interactive travel simulation game designed for women travelers. Players navigate real-world dilemmas across global destinations, building safety awareness, cultural knowledge, and travel confidence. Every scenario is dynamically generated by an LLM, grounded in real traveler experiences submitted by the community.

## What It Does

Click a country on an interactive world map and face a series of 7 realistic travel dilemmas — transportation decisions, cultural etiquette moments, street safety choices, harassment responses, and more. Every choice affects four stats:

| Stat | What It Tracks |
|---|---|
| 🔵 Safety | How well you protect yourself |
| 🟣 Confidence | How boldly you engage with the world |
| 🟢 Cultural Awareness | How deeply you connect with local culture |
| 🟡 Budget | How wisely you manage your money |

At the end, you earn a **Traveler Persona** based on your final stats. Scenarios are unique on every playthrough, and the LLM adapts difficulty to your current stats and draws on real stories submitted by the community.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A Google Cloud project with **Vertex AI API** enabled
- [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) configured locally:
  ```bash
  gcloud auth application-default login
  ```

### 1. Configure environment

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```env
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
PORT=3000
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### 3. Start the server

```bash
npm start
# or for development with auto-reload:
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` — the server serves the frontend statically.

> **No Vertex AI credentials?** The game falls back to the built-in static scenario library automatically. You can explore the full game experience without a GCP account.

## Extending the Game

**Add a new playable country:**
1. Find the ISO 3166-1 numeric code (e.g. India = `356`)
2. Add to `PLAYABLE` in `app.js`:
   ```js
   356: { code: 'IND', name: 'India', flag: '🇮🇳' }
   ```
3. Optionally add static fallback scenarios in `scenarios.js` under `SCENARIOS.IND` — the LLM will generate them live even without static data

**Add a new scenario topic:**
Extend `TOPIC_ROTATION` in `server/prompts.js` and update the modulo (`% 7` → new count). Add topic-specific guidance to `SYSTEM_PROMPT` for better LLM output.
